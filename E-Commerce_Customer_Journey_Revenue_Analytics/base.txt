so first we are not generating rows we are generating events in time.

User
1.Sgins up
2.Views Products
3.Adds to Cart
4.Purchases(sometimes)
5.is influenced by promotions

everything else comes later
so the assumptions are as follows:
5,000 customers
sign up spread over two years
segments: 
    new (60%)
    returning(25%)
    Loyal(15$)
